# BAC-MoE Model

This repository contains the implementation of the model presented in the paper:

**Boundary-Aware Collaborative Mixture-of-Experts Architecture for Fetal Brain Anatomical Segmentation**  
*Authors: [Jintang Li], [Zhan Gao], ...*  
*Published in: [Conference/Journal, 2025]*

The model is designed for the anatomical segmentation of fetal brain structures, using a boundary-aware collaborative mixture-of-experts architecture.

## Overview

This project provides a deep learning-based approach to fetal brain anatomical segmentation, leveraging a novel **Boundary-Aware Collaborative Mixture-of-Experts** architecture. This method improves the accuracy of fetal brain image segmentation by incorporating multiple expert networks that specialize in different anatomical features, while also paying special attention to the boundaries between structures.
